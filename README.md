Abstract

Many manufactures "produce" similar products based off of each other's technologies, to combat this possible patent infringing activity companies are forced to set security measures to prevent this sort of criminal act. Despite these measures it is still possible to reverse engineer these products. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how to reverse engineer a "secure" product and provide suggestions for potential additional security measures that can be used to prevent unauthorized attacks for future products.
